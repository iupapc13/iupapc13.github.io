## Open Access Journals

Progress in science is built on the existing knowledge. Access to the 
existing knowledge requires access to the journals. The price barrier
currently prevents many researchers from accessing the existing body
of knowledge. The open access journals play an important role in
mitigating this problem. They seek to return scholarly publishing to its
original purpose of spreading knowledge.
