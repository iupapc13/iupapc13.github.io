##
Experiment is what makes science different from other forms of knowledge,
every hypothesis  here must be verified by experiment. 
We need equipment to perform experiments. Lack of equipment is  one 
of the reasons for the backwardness of experiments in science education.
However, a large body of knowledge about the design and fabrication of
scientific equipment exists in the public domain. There are open instruments
applicable to various fields like education and health care. 
The IUPAP C13 commission attempts to explore this body of knowledge to: 
- Create a thematic repository for Open Source projects in instrumentation and associated tools.
- Investigate the possibility of rewarding some excellent projects on the IUPAP web site.
- Launch collaborations between developing countries. Contests.
- Create a study group on sustainable-cost scientific instrumentation and laboratory hardware. This would be the first opportunity to lobby together for sustainable-cost instrumentation and laboratory hardware.
- Assemble the main experts in the field through dedicated Hackathons.
