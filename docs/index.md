# Affordable Scientific Equipment

!!! info "Affordable Scientific Equipment"
    + The C13 Commission of IUPAP has established a Group on Affordable Scientific Equipment with the following objectives.
    
    + Create a study group on sustainable-cost scientific instrumentation and laboratory hardware. This would be the first opportunity to lobby together for sustainable-cost instrumentation and laboratory hardware.
    
    + Create a thematic repository for Open Source projects in instrumentation and associated tools.
    
    + Assemble the main experts in the field through dedicated Hackathons.
    
    + Investigate the possibility of rewarding some excellent projects on the IUPAP web site.
    
    + Launch collaborations between developing countries. Contests.

!!! quote
	Many efforts are making science more open and accessible; they are mostly concentrated on issues that appear before and after experiments are performed: open access journals,	open databases,
	and many other tools to increase reproducibility of science and access to information. However, these initiatives 
	do not promote access to scientific equipment necessary for experiments. Mostly due to monetary constraints, equipment availability has always
	been uneven around the globe, affecting predominantly low-income countries and institutions. Here, a case is made for the use of free open source hardware in research and education,
	including countries and institutions where funds were never the biggest problem.
