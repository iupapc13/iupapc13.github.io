	Many efforts are making science more open and accessible; they are mostly concentrated on issues that appear before and after experiments are performed: open access journals,	open databases,
	and many other tools to increase reproducibility of science and access to information. However, these initiatives 
	do not promote access to scientific equipment necessary for experiments. Mostly due to monetary constraints, equipment availability has always
	been uneven around the globe, affecting predominantly low-income countries and institutions. Here, a case is made for the use of free open source hardware in research and education,
	including countries and institutions where funds were never the biggest problem.
